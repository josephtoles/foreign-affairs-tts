# Foreign Affairs TTS

This program reads "Foreign Affairs" journal articles to you out loud. In retrospect, it's pretty redundant since "Foreign Affairs" lets users download mp3 readings of their articles.

## Instructions for Use

Using this program requires a paid Foreign Affairs account. Once you have purchased one, create a file in the root folder called "credentials" with a single line written {"email": "<your email here>", "password": "<your password here>"}.

This program requires you to have a number of packages installed including festival. It will use your festival program's default voice.
